# Contributing

## Before opening a PR

- Open an issue first for large changes.
- Keep changes scoped and focused.
- Confirm schema compatibility and tests pass.

## Development flow

1. Create a branch from `main`.
2. Implement and test locally.
3. Update docs/examples if behavior changed.
4. Open PR with a concise change summary.
